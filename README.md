# Goats
Project using ES6(babel), and React (w React-DI)

1) Classes act as dispatcher, store, actions

2) Viewcontrollers are top level for components get state from Classes
   passed down as props to all children

3) Components call directly to Classes (actions) via DI (dispatcher)

4) Modules wrap it all up

npm install

npm run build-js

open index.html from web folder

enjoy baby goats lol
